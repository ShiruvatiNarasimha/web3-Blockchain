//  Remix Storage Factory 


// StorageFactory in Solidity
// A StorageFactory contract is a factory contract that creates and manages multiple instances of another contract. It follows the factory pattern, which is widely used in blockchain development to deploy multiple smart contracts dynamically.

// ðŸ“Œ Why Use a StorageFactory Contract?
// Multiple Deployments â†’ Create multiple instances of a contract from one main contract.
// Centralized Management â†’ Keep track of deployed contracts.
// Scalability â†’ Instead of deploying contracts manually, automate the process.
